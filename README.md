# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide was created to give an introduction to the bootcamp. It was to learn basic concepts to build a base to be ready on day 1. This guide can be used through the bootcamp to keep notes in an organized fashion. It will serve as document that can be added to and easily accessible when a refresher is needed. So far I learned HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript.

## Usage

The prework study guide is broken up into sections that are easily identifiable. Each section contains notes related to that topic and more notes can be added at any time. It will serve as a reference guide as well as a study guide giving a random topic to study each time.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
